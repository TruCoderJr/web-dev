    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a
        new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the
        desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an
        opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography, Lee cites
        the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and
        video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall-adding in his
        autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
